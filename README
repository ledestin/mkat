MKAT
------

MKAT is a set of command line tools to burn, catalog audio or data CD-R[W]s
and then search the catalog database.

It uses mkisofs and cdrecord to create iso image and burn CDs, -r option allows 
to pass through options to cdrecord. Cdrecord and mkisofs options can be
configured in /etc/mkatrc and ~/.mkatrc. Catalog tools are mkat and mkata,
burn tools are burn and burna, with trailing `a' standing for `audio'.

It has been made because I was tired of specifying parameters to mkisofs and
cdrecord, and I also wanted a database of my CD collection that could be
simple, easy to read and searchable with grep.

NOTE: I use autofs to mount Cd-ROM for checking and cataloguing, actually, I
just don't mount it explicitly and eject after sleeping $AUTOFS_DELAY seconds.
Set unmount timeout for autofs to $AUTOFS_DELAY seconds or CD won't eject after 
everything's done. Also, it's useful to look at created iso image before 
burning, I have the following lines in my /etc/auto.misc:
iso             -fstype=iso9660,ro,sync,nodev,nosuid,loop :/home/ledestin/cdimage.iso
cd              -fstype=iso9660,ro,sync,nodev,nosuid,speed=32   :/dev/sr0
I also have a symlink
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           17 2004-04-21 13:13 /misc -> /var/autofs/misc/
so I can just say `ls /misc/iso' and see the contents of the iso image.

INSTALLATION

`make install' if you're a not Debian user, apt-get otherwise.
`make uninstall' is also available.

MKAT depends on cdrecord, mkisofs, sed, awk, cdparanoia, cd-discid present,
the last two only required for work with audio CDs.

CONFIGURATION

/etc/mkatrc and ~/.mkatrc are sourced by the tools in that order,
.mkatrc settings override global settings from /etc/mkatrc.

See manual pages for more info.

DESCRIPTION

mkat creates a file in $LISTDIR (see mkatrc) named after CD label with
first line being a label, consecutive lines listing CD contents, e.g.
FMP2 1-4
[A-F_&_AF]_Fullmetal_Panic_Fumoffu_-_04.avi:175M:b43e0fd3bd7f3afc97b47a75810276d3
[A-F_&_AF]_Fullmetal_Panic_Fumoffu_-_03.avi:175M:7cfd53c75e2753aafea0e6fddcfb4e07
[A-F_&_AF]_Fullmetal_Panic_Fumoffu_-_02.avi:175M:d6f3b47f254df00d4419fddf59919bb1
[A-F_&_AF]_Fullmetal_Panic_Fumoffu_-_01.avi:176M:635f23f89dd69fff11162a89655f5ca1

That is file description consists of the file name, size, md5 sum.

TAGS

If you wish to categorize your collection, use tags like 'movie', 'anime',
'comedy', 'adventure', etc. (e.g. 
http://animenfo.com/animetitle,114,tzoabg,cowboy_bebop.html).

You can specify tags when burning:
burn '-m-t anime,comedy,adventure' 'Cowboy Bebop' .

or when you wish to catalog already burned:
mkat -t anime,comedy,adventure

Or, if you have a .list file already, edit it, adding
"tags: anime comedy adventure" as the *SECOND* line.
$vi ~/.mkat/Cowboy\ Bebop.list

"mkat -S anime" will print all list files with "anime" tag,
"mkat -S movie,romance" will print files containing both "movie" and
"romance" tags.

List existing tags with "mkat -a".
