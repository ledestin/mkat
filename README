MKAT
------

MKAT is a set of command line tools to burn, catalog audio or data CD-R[W]s
and then search the catalog database.

It uses mkisofs and cdrecord to create iso image and burn CDs, -r option allows 
to pass through options to cdrecord. Cdrecord and mkisofs options can be
configured in /etc/mkatrc and ~/.mkatrc. Catalog tools are mkat and mkata,
burn tools are burn and burna, with trailing `a' standing for `audio'.

It has been made because I was tired of specifying parameters to mkisofs and
cdrecord, and I also wanted a database of my CD collection that could be
simple, easy to read and searchable with grep.

NOTE: I use autofs to mount Cd-ROM for checking and cataloguing, actually, I
just don't mount it explicitly and eject after sleeping $AUTOFS_DELAY seconds.
Set unmount timeout for autofs to $AUTOFS_DELAY seconds or CD won't eject after 
everything's done. Also, it's useful to look at created iso image before 
burning, I have the following lines in my /etc/auto.misc:
iso             -fstype=iso9660,ro,sync,nodev,nosuid,loop :/home/ledestin/cdimage.iso
cd              -fstype=iso9660,ro,sync,nodev,nosuid,speed=32   :/dev/sr0
I also have a symlink
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           17 2004-04-21 13:13 /misc -> /var/autofs/misc/
so I can just say `ls /misc/iso' and see the contents of the iso image.

INSTALLATION

`make install' if you're a not Debian user, apt-get otherwise.
`make uninstall' is also available.

MKAT depends on cdrecord, mkisofs, sed, awk, cdparanoia, cd-discid present,
the last two only required for work with audio CDs.

CONFIGURATION

/etc/mkatrc and ~/.mkatrc are sourced by the tools in that order,
.mkatrc settings override global settings from /etc/mkatrc.

See manual pages for more info.

DESCRIPTION

mkat creates a file in $LISTDIR (see mkatrc) named after CD label with
first line being a label, consecutive lines listing CD contents, e.g.
FMP2 1-4
[A-F_&_AF]_Fullmetal_Panic_Fumoffu_-_04.avi:175M:b43e0fd3bd7f3afc97b47a75810276d3
[A-F_&_AF]_Fullmetal_Panic_Fumoffu_-_03.avi:175M:7cfd53c75e2753aafea0e6fddcfb4e07
[A-F_&_AF]_Fullmetal_Panic_Fumoffu_-_02.avi:175M:d6f3b47f254df00d4419fddf59919bb1
[A-F_&_AF]_Fullmetal_Panic_Fumoffu_-_01.avi:176M:635f23f89dd69fff11162a89655f5ca1

That is file description consists of the file name, size, md5 sum.
